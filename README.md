# Development Process

Built from the ground up using Unity and C#, I worked independently to bring Purse Pursuit to life, using no external assets. This project allowed me to deepen my expertise in mobile game development, refining my skills in core gameplay mechanics, UI/UX design, 3D modelling, and game design.

Some key challenges included optimizing the game for different processing speeds.

The game took 8 months to develop.
